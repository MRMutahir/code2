                 <h3>Description :</h3>
                 <p>
                Welcome to the Guess My Number game! In this game, I have chosen a random number between 1 and 100. Your goal is to guess that number correctly within a limited number of attempts.</p>
                
                <h3>Rules:</h3>
                <p>
                1. You have a total of 20 points at the beginning of the game.
                2. With each guess you make, your score will be adjusted based on your accuracy.
                   - If your guess is correct, you will earn 1 point.
                   - If your guess is incorrect, you will lose 1 point.
                3. The game will provide feedback after each guess to help you get closer to the correct answer.
                4. You will also be informed whether your guess is higher or lower than the correct number.
            </p>
                
              <h3>  Instructions:</h3>
              <p>
                1. Enter your guess into the input box provided on the screen.
                2. Click the "Check" button to submit your guess.
                3. The game will evaluate your guess and provide feedback in the console.
                4. Keep guessing until you either find the correct number or run out of points.</p>
                
                <h3>Tips:</h3>
                <p>
                - Pay attention to the feedback given by the game after each guess. It will help you narrow down your search.
                - Use a systematic approach, such as starting with the middle number and adjusting your guess based on the feedback.
                
                Remember, the number I have chosen is random, so try your best to guess it correctly and maximize your score. Good luck and have fun playing the Guess My Number game!
